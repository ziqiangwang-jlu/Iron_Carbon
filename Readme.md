# My project about the study of the Fe-C system
## The Fe-C interatomic potential developed by Allera et al., which is used to describe the interaction between atoms, is adopted in my work.
This potential can not only accurately reproduce the interaction between the carbon atoms and the screw dislocation, but also simulate the glide of the screw dislocation in pure iron.
## TaR method is a computational method of translation and relaxation, which is used to find the minimum energy site
